# cleantech
Larger NLP-ECON project on the market of clean technologies


To-Do:
- [x] lemmatize semantic spaces
- [] train custom technology-related word embeddings
- [] implement "A SIMPLE BUT TOUGH-TO-BEAT BASELINE FOR SENTENCE EMBEDDINGS (2017)" as alternative proximity measure. As weights one can use the word probabilities from LLDA in the semantic technology space and tf-idfs in the company texts.
